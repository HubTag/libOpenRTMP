	\page rpc_flow RPC Flow
	
Remote procedure calls form the backbone of most application-level negotiation between RTMP endpoints. These are all transmitted using AMF commands, and follow some basic rules. While an application may choose to ignore these rules, they are generally good to follow.

A call is initiated with an AMF command message. The first element in the AMF data is a string containing the name of the procedure, and the second value is a sequence number. LibOpenRTMP will automatically handle matching the response to any RPC issued to the matching callback when possible, though not all implementations will correctly respond with the expected sequence number. The library explicitly makes no effort to provide any heuristic mechanisms for matching calls with incorrect sequence numbers, because that could lead to some unpredictable behavior.
